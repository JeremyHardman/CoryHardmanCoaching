                provide you the ability to send an electronic communication to the Company. Any such email or other
                electronic communication, however, does not create a business relationship or any contractual
                relationship. As set forth more fully in our Privacy Policy, we will take reasonable steps to ensure
                that any communications remain confidential, but we cannot guarantee the security of such communications
                and cannot guarantee that we would not be required to disclose such communications as a result of a

                material that are proper and related to the particular Communication Service.
                <br>By way of example, and not as a limitation, you agree that when using a Communication Service, you will

                privacy and publicity) of others; publish, post, upload, distribute or disseminate any inappropriate,

                necessary consents; upload files that contain viruses, corrupted files, or any other similar software or
                programs that may damage the operation of another’s computer; advertise or offer to sell or buy any

                posted by another user of a Communication Service that you know, or reasonably should know, cannot be
                legally distributed in such manner; falsify or delete any author attributions, legal or other proper
                notices or proprietary designations or labels of the origin or source of software or other material
                contained in a file that is uploaded, restrict or inhibit any other user from using and enjoying the
                Communication Services; violate any code of conduct or other guidelines which may be applicable for any
                particular Communication Service; harvest or otherwise collect information about others, including
                e-mail addresses, without their consent; violate any applicable laws or regulations.
                <br>The Company has no obligation to monitor the Communication Services. However, the Company reserves the
                right to review materials posted to a Communication Service and to remove any materials in its sole
                discretion. The Company reserves the right to terminate your access to any or all of the Communication

                Always use caution when giving out any personally identifying information about yourself in any
                Communication Service. The Company does not control or endorse the content, messages or information
                found in any Communication Service and, therefore, the Company specifically disclaims any liability with
                regard to the Communication Services and any actions resulting from your participation in any
                Communication Service. Managers and hosts are not authorized the Company spokespersons, and their views
                do not necessarily reflect those of the Company.
                <br>Materials uploaded to a Communication Service may be subject to posted limitations on usage,
                reproduction and/or dissemination. You are responsible for adhering to such limitations if you upload
                the materials.

                <br><br><b>Refunds
                </b><br>Your satisfaction with the Program is important to us. However, because of the extensive time, effort,
                preparation and care that goes into creating and providing the Program, and due to the nature of the
                Program and Content that cannot be “returned,” we have a no refund policy. We do not give partial month
                refunds, partial refunds on annual payments, or refunds of any kind.
                Unless otherwise provided by law, you acknowledge that we do not offer refunds for any portion of your
                payment for any portion of our Program and no refunds will be provided to you at any time. By using
                and/or purchasing our Program, you understand and agree that all sales are final, and no refunds will be
                provided.

                these Terms. Therefore, if a member disagrees with how the Company disciplines another member and
                requests a refund, the Company will deny such request.
                Furthermore, if a member violates these Terms, the Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion,
                to offer the member another opportunity to abide by these Terms. If a member disagrees with the Company
                offering another member a second opportunity to follow these terms, no grounds for a member to receive a
                refund would be created, and any request for a refund on this basis shall be denied.
                If, in the Company’s sole right and discretion, you persist with behaviors or actions that violate these
                Terms, the Company may terminate your access and participation in the Program without notice and without
                refund.
                <br>Since we have a clear and explicit Refund Policy in these terms of use that you have agreed to prior to
                completing the purchase of the Program, we do not tolerate or accept any type of chargeback threat or
                actual chargeback from your credit card company or payment processor. If a chargeback is placed on a
