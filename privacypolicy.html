                </b><br>When you access the Website, the Company will learn certain information about you during your visit.
                <i>Information You Provide To Us.</i> The Website provides various places for users to provide information. We
                collect information that users provide by filling out forms on the Website, communicating with us via
                contact forms, responding to surveys, inputting emails, search queries on our search feature, providing
                comments or other feedback, and providing information when ordering a product or service via the
                Website.
                <br>We use information you provide to us to deliver the requested product and/or service, to improve our
                overall performance, and to provide you with offers, promotions, and information.
                <br><i>Information We Collect Through Automatic Data Collection Technology.</i> As you navigate through our
                Website, we may use automatic data collection technologies including Google Analytics to collect certain
                information about your equipment, browsing actions, and patterns. This will generally include
                information about your location, your traffic pattern through our website, and any communications
                between your computer and our Website. Among other things, we will collect data about the type of
                computer you use, your Internet connection, your IP address, your operating system, and your browser
                type.
                <br>The information we collect automatically is used for statistical data and will not include personal
                information. We use this data to improve our Website and our service offerings. To the extent that you
                voluntarily provide personal information to us, our systems will associate the automatically collected
                information with your personal information.
                <br><br><b>Use of Cookies And Pixels
                </b><br>Similar to other commercial websites, our website utilizes a standard technology called “cookies” and
                server logs to collect information about how our site is used. Information gathered through cookies and
                server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our site, and the
                websites visited just before and just after our own, as well as your IP address.
                <br>A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you
                visit a website, that site’s computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part of
                your hard drive specifically designated for cookies. Each website can send its own cookie to your
                browser if your browser’s preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits
                a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites.
                <br>The Company reserves the right to use technological equivalents of cookies, including social media
                pixels. These pixels allow social media sites to track visitors to outside websites so as to tailor
                advertising messages users see while visiting that social media website. The Company reserves the right
                to use these pixels in compliance with the policies of the various social media sites.
                <br><br><b>Third-Party Use Of Cookies
                </b><br>Some content or applications, including advertisements, on the Website, are served by third-parties,
                including advertisers, ad networks and servers, content providers, and application providers. These
                third parties may use cookies alone or in conjunction with web beacons or other tracking technologies to
                collect information about you when you use our website. The information they collect may be associated
                with your personal information or they may collect information, including personal information, about
                your online activities over time and across different websites and other online services. They may use
                this information to provide you with interest-based (behavioral) advertising or other targeted content.
                <br>We do not control these third parties’ tracking technologies or how they may be used. If you have any
                questions about an advertisement or other targeted content, you should contact the responsible provider
                directly.
                <br><br><b>Email Information
                </b><br>If you choose to correspond with us through email, we may retain the content of your email messages
                together with your email address and our responses. We provide the same protections for these electronic
                communications that we employ in the maintenance of information received online, mail, and telephone.
