            <p>I am a mother or 3, a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and a woman trying to
                navigate this world of emotions that are constantly changing.</p>

            <p> Many years ago, as my young children became teenagers, I found myself taking on their problems and
                concerns as my own. I thought all of their feelings, actions, and decisions were a direct reflection of
                me and the way I raised them. This brought so much unnecessary pain and guilt for me. I lived in a world
                of constant guilt and regrets of what I should have done differently and how I was failing as a mother.
                My physical health suffered, my emotional health suffered, my spiritual health suffered, and my family
                relationships suffered.</p>

            <p> Fast forward 8 years. I am now raising 2 young adult children as well as a teenager. Coaching has helped
                me become the mother I want to be and show up in the ways I want to show up regardless of the actions of
                those around me. I have learned that I can choose to love my children, but not their choices. Their
                emotions, decisions, and actions are not a reflection of me or my parenting skills, but of them using
                their agency the way the choose. We are blessed that God has given all of us agency. We are the only
                ones that can choose the way we feel and the way we live our life!</p>
